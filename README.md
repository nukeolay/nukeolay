👋🏻 Hey, please call me Nukeolay. I`m Flutter mobile app developer.

🐣 Born in 1986 in Russia, I never stopped growing since.

⌨️ I started programming in 2019.  
💻 As a Flutter developer in 2020.  

🔮 I see myself coding till I die.

👨🏻‍💻 My dream job is at a product company, where I can express my love and attention for my users, fully remote or remote first, working with a fairly modern tech stack, where I can keep on learning and honing my skills.

## Highlights

📲 **peace it**
<br>Original puzzle game created with Flutter framework.
The goal is to make all cells "peaceful" within minimal moves number, by turning them over. Seems easy?
The problem is that the cells are not flipped one at a time, but together with nearest cells.
The first levels are really easy to complete, but the more levels you pass, the more difficult they becomes.
Get and use hints, go through difficult boss levels.
